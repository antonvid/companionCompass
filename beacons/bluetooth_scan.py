    A Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanner for the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

    This scanner operates in two modes:
    - 'discovery' mode: Scans for all nearby BLE devices and prints their MAC addresses.
    - 'track' mode: Continuously monitors for a specific MAC address and turns on an LED when detected.

    Attributes:
        mode (str): The scanning mode, either 'discovery' or 'track'.
        target_mac (str, optional): The MAC address of the target device in 'track' mode.
        last_seen (int): Timestamp of when the target device was last detected.
